## Context and Problem Statement
* Secure, easy and eficient login mechanism. 

## Decision Drivers
* User Experience: Providing a smooth and hassle-free login process.
* Security: Ensuring user data and credentials are protected.

## Considered Options
1. Embedding the login within the main app shell
2. A separate microfrontend for login
3. Third-party authentication service
   
## Decision Outcome
A separate microfrontend for login: because it allows for independent development, deployment, and scaling of the login functionality. It also makes it easier to integrate with various authentication services

### Consequences
* Good: Clear separation of concerns; the login microfrontend can be developed, tested, and deployed independently of other microfrontends.
* Good: Easier to implement features such as social logins or multi-factor authentication in the future.
* Bad: Additional complexity in managing state and communication between microfrontends.
