# Notes on task 9
## Business-critical workflows
- Client authentication/login 
- Q: What's our core business anyways?
- Business-critical is information collection -> that is our value, data on meat buyer behavior
- His answer: maybe we do not have any business-critical workflows but it makes sense to think 5 minutes about it...

## Short-duration workflows
- In this app, everything is a short-duration workflow. The app is mainly about quick information retrieval. Some examples below (ask if we need to specify for each)
- Q: How many short-duration workflows should we draw?
- His answer: maybe none, it depends on how you think about the app.
- My thought on this: maybe it is enough to consider the entire application as an interactive environment that does not necessarily have perfectly-specified workflows but maybe my first bullet on top is enough.

### QRreader
- needs to run quickly to get customer the feedback almost instantly
### Product specific information
- product information should be available quickly to satisfy customer demand
- but the update itself does not need to happen too quickly

## BE Orchestration
- see draw.io
