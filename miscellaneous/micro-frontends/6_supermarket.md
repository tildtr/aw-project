## Context and Problem Statement
Selection of a supermarket from which to browse and purchase meat products. 

## Decision Drivers
* User Experience: Provide a smooth and hassle-free way to select supermarkets.
* Performance: Ensure quick loading and response times when selecting a supermarket.
* Scalability: The feature must support an increasing number of supermarkets and products.
* Flexibility: Allow easy updating and addition of new supermarkets.

## Considered Options
1. Static List of Supermarkets
2. Dynamic Dropdown with Search Capability
3. Geo-Location Based Automatic Supermarket Suggestion

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: Dynamic Dropdown, because it provides a balance between user convenience and system complexity.

### Consequences
* Good: Allows users to quickly find and select a supermarket from a potentially long list.
* Good: The search capability within the dropdown can handle a growing number of supermarkets without impacting the user experience.
* Bad: Slightly more complex to implement compared to a static list.
* Bad: Requires real-time filtering which can be resource-intensive on the client side, potentially impacting performance on lower-end devices.
